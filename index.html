                    <p>Founded in 2008, Initiating Mutual Understanding through Student Exchange (IMUSE) is a collaboration between Harvard University, Peking University, and Tsinghua University students, aiming to foster mutual curiosity, respect, and understanding between people in China, Europe, and the United States by providing top college and graduate students from these regions an intimate forum for discussion and deep personal reflection about the key issues affecting China and the world today.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>To create socially intimate and intellectually meaningful face-to-face interactions among a small group of promising American and Chinese university students to increase mutual curiosity, trust, and understanding among them;</li>
                            <li>To develop an alumni network to facilitate high-impact, positive social change through the continued collaboration of former participants of IMUSE;</li>
                            <li>To maintain a strong partnership among IMUSE branches at Harvard, Peking, and Tsinghua Universities through fruitful international exchanges among board members.</li>

                    <p>We strive to achieve these goals with our biggest event, an annual 10-day conference in Beijing, bringing together top students from the United States, Europe, and China, followed by an opportunity to reflect on the experience with creative essays and photography competitions. Throughout the year, we also promote Sino-American collaboration by inviting guest speakers from top Chinese companies to Harvard University; facilitating social gatherings and mini-conferences for alumni in China and the US.</p>

Embrace this life-changing journey and join us in IMUSE 2014 to become a new group of empowering, future leaders!<br><br>

                    The theme of this year's IMUSE conference will be a combination of economics, art, and public welfare (including non-profts, NGOs, community service, volunteering, etc.). Instead of only focusing discussions on Sino-American economic relations, we hope to use art and public welfare as another pathway to understand the cultural differences between China and the United States. Similar to the 2012 and 2013 IMUSE conference, this year will also have two parts, one in Beijing and one in Hong Kong. <br><br>

                    <h3>Beijing Itinerary</h3>

                    <strong>Forum on Chinese Development:</strong><br><br>
                    The IMUSE Forum on Chinese Development will feature a series of lectures from different scholars, businessmen, and political figures. IMUSE delegates will not only be able to participate in these lectures, but will also have an opportunity to engage in discussion, debate with each other, and converse directly with these speakers. <br><br>

                    <strong>Public Welfare Theme:</strong><br><br>
                    Through volunteering, the delegates will have the opportunity to interact with the lower rungs of Chinese society and understand how the Chinese view public welfare, community service, and charity work. IMUSE delegates will also have the chance to participate in discussions with PEER, IJION, and other organizations that have contributed greatly to public welfare in China. Participants will gain a better understanding of public welfare in China and the challenges to continue its development.<br><br>

                    <strong>Economic Theme:</strong><br><br>
                    Apart from engaging in discussions about the most pressing Sino-America economic issues, Chinese and American delegates will also participate in a case-study competition at one of the most prestigious consulting firms in China. This experience will not only allow Chinese and American students to work closely together but will also expand the delegates' international scope and understanding of each others' cultures.<br><br>

                    <strong>Art Theme:</strong><br><br>
                    In our “exploration of Beijing” activity, delegates will have the opportunity to create their own personalized, one-day tour around Beijing. Delegates will have the opportunity to explore all the different types of art that are found throughout Beijing. In addition to this, students will also have the chance to work together and create their own art.<br><br>


                    <h3>Hong Kong Itinerary</h3>
                    With the support of the China Young Leaders Foundation (CYLFS), the IMUSE-Hong Kong exchange will be focused on encountering cultural differences (especially within China), understanding complex social issues, and appreciating different types of art. Here is a brief list of some of the activities already planned for Hong Kong.<br><br>
                    -Visit to slums in Sham Shui Po<br>
                    -Visit to K11 Art Mall<br>
                    -Tour around Hong Kong's top universities<br>

                    <h1>About IMUSE</h1>

                    This Chinese-American fellowship was founded in 2007 by Harvard University, Peking University, and Tsinghua University. This program recruits students from all over the world in order to facilitate understanding through cross cultral communication and friendships. IMUSE is currently one of the most influential, student-run exchange programs in China. <br><br>

                    From 2008-2013, IMUSE has successfully hosted six consecutive fellowships. Every summer, American students travel hundreds of miles to meet up with Chinese students in Beijing to participate in a two-week exchange program. In the last six years, IMUSE has inspired students to explore Sino-American relations in a global context. From the 2008 tour of North American Universities, the 2011 University of Oxford-Chinese Conference, and the 2012-2013 exchanges to Hong Kong, it is evident that IMUSE participants are not only delegates of their respective countries, but also global citizens and future leaders in our shrinking world. <br><br>

                    Over the years,  IMUSE has always stayed true to its original vision of helping students embrace our globalized world. It has provided students with an opportunity to experience cultural differences, gain insight into new perspectives, share innovative ideas, and to work together to comprehend the changes in our complex world. Because of this, IMUSE's program has been succeeded year after year, by extraordinary delegates, dedicated staff, and a large community of IMUSE supporters.<br><br>

                    IMUSE is sponsored by the Harvard IMUSE Team, Tsinghua University- Association of Student International Communication (ASIC), Peking University- Student International Communication Association (SICA), and China Young Leaders Foundation (CYLDS)

After about two years of trying to teach herself Mandarin to supplement her Taiwan drama addiction in high school, Rose-Ann formally started Chinese language instruction after matriculating into Harvard, where her interest in China began. After a short stint as a Chemistry concentrator, she decided to fully devote herself to East Asian Studies in her junior year, eventually adding a joint-concentration in Anthropology. Rose-Ann enjoys travel and learning new languages and has been to China every summer since 2012. She hopes to go into policy one day to help create solutions to issues in healthcare and education inequality. In her ever-shorter periods of free time, you can find her asleep at her desk, watching TV on her laptop, or lamenting about the current state of her thesis."><b>Rose-Ann Thomas</b></a>

                            <h2>2008 Overview</h2>
                            <p>IMUSE kicked off its inaugural year with four programs designed to bring an objective and affirmative introduction of the Beijing Olympics and modern China to as wide an audience of North American students as possible:<p>
                            <h3>North American Campus Tour Program</h3>
                            <p>
                            In the winter of 2007, IMUSE selected fifteen student delegates from over 600 applicants at Tsinghua and Peking Universities to visit eleven North American universities in the spring of 2008. At each institution, the delegates engaged journalists, academics, and local student leaders before a local audience in moderated panel discussions about a number of different topics concerning China, such as its increasingly influential role in the global marketplace, its slowly westernizing culture, the balance between its environmental consciousness and its economic growth, and more. Specific topics of discussion were based on the results of the &ldquo;My Top Ten&rdquo; poll posted on our website last winter and spring, which received over 1200 responses from hundreds of different schools.<br><br>
                            In concert with these panel discussions, IMUSE offered other on-campus events at each university, including talks by prominent guest speakers from Dr. David Kang to Mr. Jet Li, documentary screenings, &ldquo;Landscapes of Modern China,&rdquo; a professional photo exhibition prepared by Kodak, and a variety of school-specific workshops, performances, and other activities.<br><br>
                            </p>
                            <h3>&ldquo;China in my Eyes&rdquo; Essay and Photography Competition </h3>
                            <p>
                            Since North American Campus Tour events were limited to select schools, IMUSE also designed the "China in My Eyes" essay and photography competition, open to all North American postsecondary school students. The competition encouraged its entrants to carefully examine their own views about China and convey their ideas through original essays or photographs. The six grand-prize winners of the essay and photography competitions received either a new Lenovo laptop or a spot in our Beijing Olympic Summer Fellowship Program. The twenty runners-up each received a set of five officially licensed Beijing Olympic souvenir coins (global circulation: 60,000). All competition winners received personalized certificates and publication of their winning entries on our website.<br><br>
                            </p>
                            <h3>&ldquo;My Top Ten&rdquo; Survey of Important Issues Facing Modern China </h3>
                            <p>
                            From winter 2007 to spring 2008, the IMUSE website hosted a survey regarding various issues being addressed by China today, from environmental pollution and governmental corruption to human rights and religious freedom. North American postsecondary school students were eligible to select ten of twenty choices that they felt demanded the most urgent attention. The survey ultimately had over 1200 responses from hundreds of different schools, and the results were used to design the questions for our North American Campus Tour panel discussions.
                            <br><br>
                            </p>
                            <h3>Beijing Olympic Summer Fellowship Program </h3>
                            <p>
                            Three of our five grand-prize &ldquo;China in my Eyes&rdquo; competition winners and our &ldquo;My Top Ten&rdquo; survey winner attended the 2008 Beijing Olympic Summer Fellowship Program in Beijing during the first two weeks of August 2008. The purpose of the fellowship was to broaden the North American students&rsquo; perspective on China by bringing them not just to traditional tourist sites but also to places of historical and contemporary significance. Each fellow was assigned a Chinese student liaison to help them with language and culture differences as well as deepen and personalize the exchange experience. In addition to visiting a number of cultural sites, attending Olympic events, and participating in academic lectures and conversation tables, the fellows and liaisons also held a public panel discussion at Peking University similar to those hosted by our fourteen Chinese delegates during the North American Campus Tour Program.<br><br>

                                        <h2>China Development Forum</h2><br>
                                        <p>The 2011 Fellowship began with a half-day forum event at the prestigious Peking University spotlighting philanthropy and social entrepreneurship in China. Our delegates got the chance to interact with representatives from groups and organizations leading the way, such as UChange, CSR-Asia, China Youth Action Network, and Xiaoying Plan.</p>
                                        <br>
                                        <h2>Academic Lectures</h2><br>
                                        <p>Renowned professors from top Chinese universities such as Peking University presented on issues ranging from the Chinese healthcare reform to the economics of the rural-urban divide in China to China's rise as a world power. These presentations were followed by informal Q&A sessions with the professors.</p>
                                        <br>
                                        <h2>Hejun Consulting</h2><br>

                                        <p>This full-day event introduced fellowship participants to the process of developing effective business pitches and provided an inside look into the differences between doing business in the US and doing business in China. Delegates split into small teams and prepared comprehensive company expansion strategies tailor-made to a number of handpicked firms. Business proposals were later presented to top management at Hejun Consulting, one of the premier consulting firms in China. In the process, our delegates received significant feedback and in-house coaching from senior-level Hejun consultants.</p>
                                        <br>
                                        <h2>Wangfujing Scavenger Hunt</h2><br>

                                        <p>It's definitely not all business, work, and academics at IMUSE! Our delegates revisited grade school years through a good ol' scavenger hunt game played in Beijing's most celebrated commercial shopping boulevard: Wanfujing. Got scorpion sticks? Stone yogurt jars? How about the elusive Well? </p>

                                        <h2>Karaoke Night</h2><br>
                                        <p>IMUSE staff rented the largest private room in a famous Beijing karaoke hall for a fun-filled night of top American pop and classic Chinese oldies. What ensued was an amazing showcase of the skills of the many hidden singing talents among our delegates! </p>

                                        <p>In this new collaboration with New Citizen Plan, IMUSE delegates were allowed poignant glimpse into the lives of children caught in the deep rural-urban divide in China. In this half-day visit to one of the many impoverished migrant children's schools in Beijing, delegates got the opportunity to hear firsthand from these children about the impact wrought by their displacement and ensuing soft marginalization. This event gave delegates a greater awareness of the often-overlooked costs of rapid economic development and urbanization.</p>

                                        <p>These sessions at the prestigious Tsinghua University introduced IMUSE delegates to various and varied aspects of the economic, political, and social landscapes of China. Selected speakers included the notable political blogger Michael Anti, the Secretary General of Vantone Foundation Li Jing, the co-founder of China Fine Art Management Christopher Reynolds and the Director of Technical Development at Hyatt International Daniel Wang.</p>

                                    <p> A huge part of cultural exchange is, well, culture! In the spirit of that assessment, IMUSErs sat down for some informal conversation with their peers. What did they chat about?

                                <p>Tea plays an important role in Chinese culture. In this ceremony, delegates were trained in the fine art of making Puer Tea.

                                <p>Delegates visited a picturesque bookstore owned by Zheng Yu and Mr. Lv. The owners spoke of their dream to provide an environment for readers, though that dream is being threatened by larger firms and e-Books. Touched by the idealism of this dream, delegates analyzed and discussed the situation and proposed some possible suggestions for improvement.</p>

                                <p>Even the ten-hour train ride from Beijing to Shenzhen didn’t faze the IMUSE attendees, who chatted and played like family members the whole time. After arriving in Hong Kong, delegates took a tour of K11, a distinctive “art mall” that integrates art exhibits with retail stores.</p>
                                <p>They then made their way to a slum called Sham Shui Po, an area that starkly contrasts with the rest of the metropolis that is Hong Kong. The residents of Sham Shui Po are faced with many difficulties associated with poverty, such as crowding, lack of living space, poorly-constructed homes, and lack of sanitation. Delegates were so deeply shocked when they visited SoCO, a local charity, where they raised questions and suggestions on public welfare, wealth gap and social mobility.</p>
                                <br>
