                    <h1>About IMUSE</h1>
                    This Chinese-American fellowship was founded in 2007 by Harvard University, Peking University, and Tsinghua University. This program recruits students from all over the world in order to facilitate mutual understanding through cross-cultural communication and friendship. IMUSE is currently one of the most influential, student-run exchange programs in China. IMUSE has three primary goals:
                    <ul>
                        <li>To facilitate socially intimate and intellectually meaningful face-to-face interactions among a small group of promising American and Chinese university students in order to increase mutual curiosity, respect, and understanding among them;</li>
                        <li>To maintain the trans-national and trans-cultural connections created amongst staff and participants beyond the IMUSE conference and connect future leaders from both the East and the West through an active alumni network and a strong partnership among IMUSE branches at Harvard, Peking University, and Tsinghua University;</li>
                        <li>To challenge and inspire our delegates to be “globally proficient” through widening their cultural perspective, encouraging innovative collaboration and critical thinking, and emphasizing skills such as leadership and social responsibility, thereby equipping delegates with the skills to adapt to and thrive in new environments as well as enact high-impact, culturally-informed positive change.</li>
                    </ul>
                    We strive to achieve these goals with our biggest event, an annual conference in China. From 2008-2014, IMUSE has successfully hosted seven consecutive fellowships. Every summer, American students travel hundreds of miles to meet up with Chinese students in Beijing to participate in this two-week program. In the last seven years, IMUSE has inspired students to explore Sino-American relations in a global context through venues as varied as art, debate, and community service. Past events have included:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Visiting the historic slums of Sham Shui Po, Hong Kong</li>
                        <li>Economic case study during a company visit to Hejun Consulting</li>
                        <li>Touring Hong Kong's top universities</li>
                        <li>Visiting a migrant children’s school</li>
                        <li>Touring the U.S. Embassy</li>
                        <li>Exploring Beijing’s famed 798 Art District</li>
                        <li>Volunteering at Sun Village (non-profit NGO caring for children of Chinese prisoners)</li>
                        <li>Learning about Chinese tea culture at one of the oldest teahouses in Beijing</li>
                        <li>Discussions about public welfare with activists from PEER (NGO dedicated to increasing access to education for migrant children)</li>
                        <li>Academic lectures featuring professors from Peking and Tsinghua University</li>
                    </ul>
                    ...and much more!

                    From the 2008 tour of North American Universities, to the 2011 University of Oxford-Chinese Conference, to the 2012-2014 exchanges in Beijing and Hong Kong, it is evident that IMUSE participants are not only delegates of their respective countries, but also global citizens and future leaders in our increasingly interconnected world. 
                    <br><br>
                    Over the years, IMUSE has always stayed true to its original vision of helping students learn to embrace and thrive in our globalized society. It has provided students with an opportunity to experience cultural differences, form and share innovative ideas, gain insight into new perspectives, and work together to apply this global knowledge and cosmopolitan understanding in ways that can meet the demands of our complex and changing world. Because of this, IMUSE's program has been succeeded year after year by extraordinary delegates, dedicated staff, and a large community of IMUSE supporters.
                    <br><br>
                    IMUSE is organized by the Harvard IMUSE Team, Tsinghua University- Association of Student International Communication (ASIC), and Peking University- Student International Communication Association (SICA), with generous support from the China Young Leaders Foundation (CYLDS)

                            <h2>2008 Overview</h2>
                            <p>IMUSE kicked off its inaugural year with four programs designed to bring an objective and affirmative introduction of the Beijing Olympics and modern China to as wide an audience of North American students as possible:<p>
                            <h3>North American Campus Tour Program</h3>
                            <p>
                            In the winter of 2007, IMUSE selected fifteen student delegates from over 600 applicants at Tsinghua and Peking Universities to visit eleven North American universities in the spring of 2008. At each institution, the delegates engaged journalists, academics, and local student leaders before a local audience in moderated panel discussions about a number of different topics concerning China, such as its increasingly influential role in the global marketplace, its slowly westernizing culture, the balance between its environmental consciousness and its economic growth, and more. Specific topics of discussion were based on the results of the &ldquo;My Top Ten&rdquo; poll posted on our website last winter and spring, which received over 1200 responses from hundreds of different schools.<br><br>
                            In concert with these panel discussions, IMUSE offered other on-campus events at each university, including talks by prominent guest speakers from Dr. David Kang to Mr. Jet Li, documentary screenings, &ldquo;Landscapes of Modern China,&rdquo; a professional photo exhibition prepared by Kodak, and a variety of school-specific workshops, performances, and other activities.<br><br>
                            </p>
                            <h3>&ldquo;China in my Eyes&rdquo; Essay and Photography Competition </h3>
                            <p>
                            Since North American Campus Tour events were limited to select schools, IMUSE also designed the "China in My Eyes" essay and photography competition, open to all North American postsecondary school students. The competition encouraged its entrants to carefully examine their own views about China and convey their ideas through original essays or photographs. The six grand-prize winners of the essay and photography competitions received either a new Lenovo laptop or a spot in our Beijing Olympic Summer Fellowship Program. The twenty runners-up each received a set of five officially licensed Beijing Olympic souvenir coins (global circulation: 60,000). All competition winners received personalized certificates and publication of their winning entries on our website.<br><br>
                            </p>
                            <h3>&ldquo;My Top Ten&rdquo; Survey of Important Issues Facing Modern China </h3>
                            <p>
                            From winter 2007 to spring 2008, the IMUSE website hosted a survey regarding various issues being addressed by China today, from environmental pollution and governmental corruption to human rights and religious freedom. North American postsecondary school students were eligible to select ten of twenty choices that they felt demanded the most urgent attention. The survey ultimately had over 1200 responses from hundreds of different schools, and the results were used to design the questions for our North American Campus Tour panel discussions.
                            <br><br>

                            <h3>Beijing Olympic Summer Fellowship Program </h3>
                            <p>
                            Three of our five grand-prize &ldquo;China in my Eyes&rdquo; competition winners and our &ldquo;My Top Ten&rdquo; survey winner attended the 2008 Beijing Olympic Summer Fellowship Program in Beijing during the first two weeks of August 2008. The purpose of the fellowship was to broaden the North American students&rsquo; perspective on China by bringing them not just to traditional tourist sites but also to places of historical and contemporary significance. Each fellow was assigned a Chinese student liaison to help them with language and culture differences as well as deepen and personalize the exchange experience. In addition to visiting a number of cultural sites, attending Olympic events, and participating in academic lectures and conversation tables, the fellows and liaisons also held a public panel discussion at Peking University similar to those hosted by our fourteen Chinese delegates during the North American Campus Tour Program.<br><br>

                                        <p>The 2011 Fellowship began with a half-day forum event at the prestigious Peking University spotlighting philanthropy and social entrepreneurship in China. Our delegates got the chance to interact with representatives from groups and organizations leading the way, such as UChange, CSR-Asia, China Youth Action Network, and Xiaoying Plan.</p>

                                        <h2>Academic Lectures</h2><br>
                                        <p>Renowned professors from top Chinese universities such as Peking University presented on issues ranging from the Chinese healthcare reform to the economics of the rural-urban divide in China to China's rise as a world power. These presentations were followed by informal Question and Answer sessions with the professors.</p>

                                        <p>This full-day event introduced fellowship participants to the process of developing effective business pitches and provided an inside look into the differences between doing business in the US and doing business in China. Delegates split into small teams and prepared comprehensive company expansion strategies tailor-made to a number of handpicked firms. Business proposals were later presented to top management at Hejun Consulting, one of the premier consulting firms in China. In the process, our delegates received significant feedback and in-house coaching from senior-level Hejun consultants.</p>

                                        <p>It's definitely not all business, work, and academics at IMUSE! Our delegates revisited grade school years through a good ol' scavenger hunt game played in Beijing's most celebrated commercial shopping boulevard: Wanfujing. Got scorpion sticks? Stone yogurt jars? How about the elusive Well? </p>

                                        <h2>Karaoke Night</h2><br>

                                        <p>In this new collaboration with New Citizen Plan, IMUSE delegates were allowed poignant glimpse into the lives of children caught in the deep rural-urban divide in China. In this half-day visit to one of the many impoverished migrant children's schools in Beijing, delegates got the opportunity to hear firsthand from these children about the impact wrought by their displacement and ensuing soft marginalization. This event gave delegates a greater awareness of the often-overlooked costs of rapid economic development and urbanization.</p>

                                <p>Delegates spent two days at a training center for outdoors surviving skills in suburban Beijing. They practiced walking through a single-plunk bridge and crossing the “forest” at midnight, then held a campfire party and with several group games and contests.</p>

                                <p>Afterwards, Zheng Peiming, founder of the Shanghai Rongzheng Investing and Consulting Company, spoke about his experiences in starting his own company. He compared the cultural and economic environments in China and the U.S. and how they affect businesses.</p>
                                <br>

                                <p>Delegates watched a pair of videos that represented views on the “American dream” and the “Chinese dream.” The first was Richard Wilkinson’s TED talk, “How Economic Inequalities Harms Societies.” The second was a film shot by Tsinghua students about a blanket craftsman in Tibet. Delegates discussed the concepts of equality, development, and the protection of art and cultural heritage.</p>

                                <p>Delegates participated in a meditation session led by an expert, and complete with relaxing music. As meditation is a way to better understand oneself, the process for involved a bit of soul-searching: delegates were asked to ponder what they were like as a child, what they are like at present, and they hope to be in the future.</p>

                                <p>Li Shen of Peking University delivered the welcome address on behalf of IMUSE 2013 committee. Then, several conference delegates got on stage to share their stories. The ceremony concluded with delegates coming together to write their hopes for IMUSE 2013 on a postcard.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h2>Tea Drinking</h2><br>

                                <p>Tea plays an important role in Chinese culture. In this ceremony, delegates were trained in the fine art of making Puer Tea. Led by a hostess in traditional Chinese dress, delegates followed step-by-step instructions for brewing and serving, tasting the beauty of ancient Chinese culture.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h2>Academic Lecture</h2><br>

                                <p>Bai Yanqing, Tsinghua University guest professor, shared his own stories of America, pondering the essence of the American dream and discussing hopes for the Chinese dream from the point of view of Chinese scholars.</p>
                                <br>

                                <p>Delegates visited a picturesque bookstore owned by Zheng Yu and Mr. Lv. The owners spoke of their dream to provide an environment for readers, though that dream is being threatened by larger firms and e-Books. Touched by the idealism of this dream, delegates analyzed and discussed the situation and proposed some possible suggestions for improvement.</p>
                                <br>

                                <p>Even the ten-hour train ride from Beijing to Shenzhen didn’t faze the IMUSE attendees, who chatted and played like family members the whole time. After arriving in Hong Kong, delegates took a tour of K11, a distinctive “art mall” that integrates art exhibits with retail stores.</p>
                                <p>They then made their way to a slum called Sham Shui Po, an area that starkly contrasts with the rest of the metropolis that is Hong Kong. The residents of Sham Shui Po are faced with many difficulties associated with poverty, such as crowding, lack of living space, poorly-constructed homes, and lack of sanitation. Delegates were so deeply shocked when they visited SoCO, a local charity, where they raised questions and suggestions on public welfare, wealth gap and social mobility.</p>
                                <br>

                                <p>The ceremony begins launched with the presentation of each groups’ projects in the business planning workshop. Afterwards, each delegate shared their favorite stories and takeaways from IMUSE 2013 and signed their names on huge goodbye card. Although the closing ceremony marked the end of the IMUSE 2013 Beijing Session, was not the end of friendships built there.</p>
