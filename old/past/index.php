Two weeks is only a flash in life, however, you will establish life-long friendship with a lot of insightful young people who seek 
for mutual understanding. People here are unique, passionate and modest, and most excitingly, they know more about your culture than 
you might expect. They give you an external point of view to examine your own pattern of life from the eye of "the other" -- it's amazingly cool 
and definitely meaningful.
