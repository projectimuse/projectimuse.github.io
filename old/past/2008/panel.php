<h2>Campus Tour Events</h2>
<div id="content">
        Our 2008 North American campus tour program involves visiting several North American universities in order to host
        conferences whose main aim is to increase the objectivity and complexity of North American students&#39;
        understanding of China. Designed to offer a variety of perspectives on issues in the foreign relations, government, economy, social
        structure, and popular culture of the country, these conferences encompass a number of events, including :
        <br><br>
        - panel discussions among student delegates from Peking and Tsinghua Universities,
        <br>
        - meetings with student leaders, and journalists, professors, and other experts on China,
        <br>
        - talks and question-and-answer sessions with prominent speakers,
        <br>
        - a photo exhibition on modern China sponsored by Kodak,
        <br>
        - screenings of documentaries and popular movies,
        <br>
        - performances and cultural workshops, and catered social events.

      Each campus visit included at least one celebrated speaker to talk about international relations between China and the United States, as well as at least one publicly open discussion among local student leaders, Chinese student delegates, and experts on China to discuss topics chosen in a survey of North American tertiary school students. <br><br>
      Fourteen student delegates were selected from a large and extremely competitive pool of over 600 candidates at Peking and Tsinghua Universities to participate in the campus tour panel discussions, speaker events, and socials with the students of each school visited during the program. They represent a wide range of interests and  educational specializations and offered a rich collection of perspectives to the students with whom they interacted during the campus tour. <br><br>

	<h3>Landscapes of Modern China</h3>
	
	The IMUSE 2008 "Landscapes of Modern China" photo exhibition was displayed at each
	of the schools visited on our North American campus tour. Prepared and donated by our
	sponsors at Kodak, the gallery consisted of twelve separate square-meter panels and
	included more than 90 photographic depictions by <i>National Geographic</i> of the beautiful
	natural features, pastoral rural communities, stirring urban scenes, and daily lives
	of students and other inhabitants of China.<br><br>


	  <h3>Panel Discussion</h3>
      Panel  discussions included questions like the following:<br>
	<p>
      <ul>
        <li>In your  opinion, what are some of the most frustrating misconceptions that Americans  have about China? What are the three most frustrating misconceptions that  Chinese people have about America? What can be done to rectify these  misconceptions?</li><br>
		<img class="imgr" src="../../images/programs/2008/panel.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 180px;">
        <li>According to  a 2007 <i>Newsweek</i> poll, about 90% of Americans say that they identify with  a specific religion. Conversely, in China, the US Department of State reports  that most of the country does not follow any organized religion-adherents to  Buddhism, the most popular religion, represent only 8% of the population.  Should we take these statistics to mean that Chinese people are less spiritual  than Americans? From what sources do Chinese people derive their ethical  ideals? How might this cultural difference impact relations between Americans  and Chinese?</li><br>	
		
        <li>Celebrities  like Jet Li, Jackie Chan, and Zhang Ziyi have achieved widespread popularity in  America. At the same time, many American personalities have also gained  celebrity status in China. Do what extent do you think each country's cultural  exports accurately represent their respective societies?</li>
      </ul>
	  </p>
      Our panel  discussions were among the most popular events at our conferences and garnered  a collective audience of more than 3,000 students.
