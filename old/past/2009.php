						<h2>Simulation: Business Case</h2><br><br>
						<p class="imgholder"><img class="imgl" src="../../images/programs/2009/business.jpg" alt="" /></p>
						<p>What does it take to run a successful business in China? When the Chinese economy was growing at a breakneck pace of over 10% a year, ambitious entrepreneurs both within and without China flocked to set up shop in China to make a fortune. Yet even before the onset of the economic downturn, there were thousands of such companies that went bankrupt every year. In this interactive exercise, each small group will be in charge of developing the best type of business and the best business model to fit a niche in the Beijing market based on demographic, economic, regulatory, ecologic, and infrastructural factors, as well as some unforeseen surprises, led by a couple of our resident consultants. </p>

						<h2>Talk: Minority Groups and Race</h2><br><br>
						<p class="imgholder"><img class="imgr" src="../../images/programs/2009/discussion.jpg" alt="" /></p>
						<p>China prides itself on having 56 ethnicities. The United States prides itself on being the melting pot/salad bowl of ethnicities. Yet both countries have had long-standing issues with minority and race relations. In this session we will go beyond a surface-level discourse focusing on oppression or border areas that is prevalent in the media and try to delve deeper into how race and ethnicity plays out in day-to-day settings in settings close to home such as the university campus. To facilitate this discussion, we will hear from Chinese college students from minority groups to hear about their experiences and opinions, to be followed by a comparative discussion with race relations in the United States. </p>

						<h2>American Etiquette Dinner</h2><br><br>
						<p class="imgholder"><img class="imgl" src="../../images/programs/2009/eating.jpg" alt="" /></p>
						<p>Ever wondered why up-scale Western restaurants have so many sets of utensils or whether the glass on your left or your right is yours? We will find out when we get a crash course in Western formal dining etiquette at a nice restaurant with delicious food. This will come in handy since not all Americans are cowboys who have no regard for formalities. </p>

						<p>Dumplings (jiaozi) are one of the many delectable Chinese foods, and on top of that they are easy to make. We will engage in making (and eating) dumplings with the Community of the Mentally Disabled, an nonprofit organization. This will help us better understand the state of nonprofit organizations today, in mental health organizations in particular. </p>

						<p>After our trek to the Great Wall, we will be spending the rest of the day and the night at a rural village nearby in SiMaTai, where you can interact with the local townspeople, gather food in the mountains, and get a first-hand exposure to a rural village. Things to keep in mind are, how is this village different from the city? To what extent is this village typical of rural villages in China? What impact does tourism have on rural areas? </p>

						<h2>Olympics, a Review</h2>
						<br><br>
						<p>Get a chance to interact with student volunteers from the 2008 Beijing Olympics! Ask them about their experiences volunteering in the Olympics and reflect on Mr. Zhang Yi Mouâ€™s presentation. 
						<br>The run-up to the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic was fraught with controversy and tension, with the world's attention intensely focused on China with a plethora of analyses and predictions about the impact of the Olympics on China. Yet after the Olympic torch was extinguished, it seems that much of the attention has subsided. How has life in Beijing and the rest of China changed since August 2008? How is Beijing coping with the remains of the Olympics? How are Chinese remembering and evaluating the Olympics? We will first hear from a speaker who was deeply involved with BOCOG (Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games), to be followed by a round-table discussion over lunch.</p>

						<h2>Human Rights in US/China</h2><br><br>
						<p class="imgholder"><img class="imgl" src="../../images/programs/2009/tiananmen.jpg" alt="" /></p>    
						<p>One of the most contentious issues in U.S.-China relations has been the issue of human rights in China, yet there is a great amount of misunderstanding of what each side means by human rights. The simple dichotomy is that the Chinese government emphasizes raising people out of poverty as a improvement in human rights while the American government does not recognize that as a human rights improvement and focuses on political rights. After hearing from an expert about the topic, we will broach this sensitive topic in a respectful manner so that we understand everyone's positions.</p>
