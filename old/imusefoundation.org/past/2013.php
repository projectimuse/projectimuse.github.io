            <p>Afterwards, Zheng Peiming, founder of the Shanghai Rongzheng Investing and Consulting Company, spoke about his experiences in starting his own company. He compared the cultural and economic environments in China and the U.S. and how they affect businesses.</p>

            <p>Delegates watched a pair of videos that represented views on the “American dream” and the “Chinese dream.” The first was Richard Wilkinson’s TED talk, “How Economic Inequalities Harms Societies.” The second was a film shot by Tsinghua students about a blanket craftsman in Tibet. Delegates discussed the concepts of equality, development, and the protection of art and cultural heritage.</p>

            <p>Every year, IMUSE visits the Hejun Consulting. Activities included a cultural workshop on calligraphy and painting, as well as a professional workshop involving consulting competition.

            <p>Delegates participated in a meditation session led by an expert, and complete with relaxing music. As meditation is a way to better understand oneself, the process for involved a bit of soul-searching: delegates were asked to ponder what they were like as a child, what they are like at present, and they hope to be in the future.</p>

            <p>Tea plays an important role in Chinese culture. In this ceremony, delegates were trained in the fine art of making Puer Tea.

            <p>Bai Yanqing, Tsinghua University guest professor, shared his own stories of America, pondering the essence of the American dream and discussing hopes for the Chinese dream from the point of view of Chinese scholars.</p>

            <p>Delegates visited a picturesque bookstore owned by Zheng Yu and Mr. Lv. The owners spoke of their dream to provide an environment for readers, though that dream is being threatened by larger firms and e-Books. Touched by the idealism of this dream, delegates analyzed and discussed the situation and proposed some possible suggestions for improvement.</p>

            <p>Even the ten-hour train ride from Beijing to Shenzhen didn’t faze the IMUSE attendees, who chatted and played like family members the whole time. After arriving in Hong Kong, delegates took a tour of K11, a distinctive “art mall” that integrates art exhibits with retail stores.</p>
            <p>They then made their way to a slum called Sham Shui Po, an area that starkly contrasts with the rest of the metropolis that is Hong Kong. The residents of Sham Shui Po are faced with many difficulties associated with poverty, such as crowding, lack of living space, poorly-constructed homes, and lack of sanitation. Delegates were so deeply shocked when they visited SoCO, a local charity, where they raised questions and suggestions on public welfare, wealth gap and social mobility.</p>

            <p>The ceremony begins launched with the presentation of each groups’ projects in the business planning workshop. Afterwards, each delegate shared their favorite stories and takeaways from IMUSE 2013 and signed their names on huge goodbye card. Although the closing ceremony marked the end of the IMUSE 2013 Beijing Session, was not the end of friendships built there.</p>
