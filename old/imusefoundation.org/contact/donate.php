Dear <i>Potential Benefactor,</i><br><br>
IMUSE is a non-profit organization aiming to foster a strong relationship between young Chinese and U.S students. Our annual conference is always subsidized for delegates, and all ground transportation, food, and events are free of charge. We want to keep our conference financially .. for all our delegates. In order to do that, IMUSE needs your help! 
Any monetary donations or company sponsorships are greatly appreciated and all proceeds would go to making our Beijing conference as memorable as possible.
<br><br>
At this time, we are still working on our paypal account to get a donate button on the site!<br><br>
In the mean time, please <a href="../contact/">contact us</a> or email us <a href="mailto: admin@projectimuse.org">directly</a> with your interest in donating.<br><br>
Thank you so much for your help!<br>

Sincerely,<br>
<i>IMUSE team</i>
<br><br><br><br>

Believe me, my time with IMUSE 2009 in Beijing was brilliant. Instead of being a formal conference or workshop, the program more looks like forming up a family. The organizing team was focused, passionate. They brought the best part of Beijing in that summer to the members in the program.
